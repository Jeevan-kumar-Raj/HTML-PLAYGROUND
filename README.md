# HTML-PLAYGROUND
HTML Playground is a simple project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you open the project, you can see the editor page on your browser where you can type code on one side of the page. Also, see its results on another side at the same time.

You can also play with the css and javascript from the page. Here, we can only see the content that we write inside the body tag. While the codes inside other tags is not seen but it helps in making some changes to the body content.
